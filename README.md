Line 133: I used the skeleton of Exercise 1D to build my project because it was super interesting, using the timer as a day and night cycle boosted my ideas for what I wanted to do for my game, the advance_time references itself for time. 

I most definitely have more than 8 knots. [+2 points]

Line 160, 171, 191 are random shuffle functions decided to tell the weather, along with what fish you'll be cacthing randomly. 
In order for Line 191 to work, you must get your strength up to a certain level (line 91 and 99), the game will automatically level you up, so you can access the Fishing pond lvl 2. You can check all the stuff you have with the inventory check I made, and I made it so that checking your stats does not advance time, but takes you back to selecting your options (line 112 and 120).

In knot beach2, theres line 54 and 60 that go together. These lines only work for the first time in the game, so they wont be seen after you click off of it. I didn't make any lines that referenced old areas, but I did make lines that cycle randomly to keep the text fresh. [+0.75 points]

I have 3 variables that count toward your stats, along with lines 107 and 115 displaying those stats. You need to get a certain amount of stats to beat the game, with 2 endings, you either get the required 3 stats, or forget to fish at all. One being the good ending, and the other being the bad ending. The option to fish in a much more difficult spot will only be available when the criteria is met (line 37), and there are hints throughout the game to let you know what might be needed. [+1 point]
